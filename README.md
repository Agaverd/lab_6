# SOLID Principles explanation

**S — Single Responsibility Principle**  
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
**O — Open/Closed Principle**  
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
**L — Liskov Substitution Principle**  
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. 
**I — Interface Segregation Principle**  
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
**D — Dependency Inversion Principle**  
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
